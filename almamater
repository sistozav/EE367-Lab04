In green Manoa Valley our Alma Mater stands
Where mountain winds and showers refresh her fertile lands;

Hawai`i, we have gathered within thy wide-flung doors,
As sons and daughters claiming her freely offered stores;
Our loyal priase we tender, and pledge to hold thy aim,
Till ocean's far horizons shall hear thy honored name.
